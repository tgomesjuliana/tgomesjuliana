# **About me**
With over 4 years of experience in analytics, specifically within the finance and business domains of fast-paced startups like Nubank and Isaac, I have gained expertise in developing infrastructure solutions, financial forecasts and business monitorings, always focusing on optimizing both profitability and growth. Now I am actively seeking opportunities as a data scientist or a machine learning engineer as the next phase of my career.
